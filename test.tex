\section{Introduction}
If you install LaTeX for your Operating System and install a tool like Jabref, you can create a repository that you can reference and cite automatically from.
If you use \cite{Sanjay2013} and in Jabref, if you have an entry with that key, it automatically inserts the reference.

One possible problem is if the reference contains the \&. You will get an error in LaTeX when you try and compile it.
You need to open the BibTeX file, right click, open in notepad,
Find the offending \& and put a backslash in front of it. Save the file and recompile and it should work!







\bibliographystyle{agsm}

% The name of your Jabref file, in this case references, and should be in the same folder as this tex file
\bibliography{references}
