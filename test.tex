\title{A Template for Using BibTeX references with LaTeX}
\author{Leigh Griffin}

\section{Introduction}
If you install LaTeX for your Operating System and install a tool like Jabref, you can create a repository that you can reference and cite automatically from.
If you use \cite{Sanjay2013} and in Jabref, if you have an entry with that key, it automatically inserts the reference. \\ \\

One possible problem is if the reference contains the \&. You will get an error in LaTeX when you try and compile it. The error will look like this:

\begin{lstlisting}
Misplaced alignment tab character &.
\end{lstlisting}

The Play button that you click to run and compile the document will stay as a red X.

You need to open the BibTeX file, right click, open in notepad,
Find the offending \& and put a backslash in front of it. Save the file and recompile and it should work!

\section{Structure of a normal BibTeX entry}

\begin{lstlisting}
@Article{Sanjay2013,
  author    = {Sanjay, Bhasin},
  journal   = {Journal of Manufacturing Technology Management},
  title     = {Analysis of whether Lean is viewed as an ideology by British organizations},
  year      = {2013},
  issn      = {1741-038X},
  month     = jan,
  number    = {4},
  pages     = {536--554},
  volume    = {24},
  abstract  = {The full abstract normally appears here, but I am snipping it for ease of reading},
  doi       = {10.1108/17410381311327396},
  publisher = {Emerald Group Publishing Limited},
  url       = {https://doi.org/10.1108/17410381311327396},
}

\end{lstlisting}

\section{Structure of a BibTeX entry that has an \& in it}

Normally the troublesome \& is in the Title or Publisher section, see an example below and the symbol to escape it with the backslash

\begin{lstlisting}
@Book{edmonson2018,
  author    = {Amy C. Edmondson},
  publisher = {John Wiley \& Sons},
  title     = {The Fearless Organization: Creating Psychological Safety in the Workplace for Learning, Innovation, and Growth},
  year      = {2018},
}

\end{lstlisting}
